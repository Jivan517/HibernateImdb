Hibernate Practice

Goal: To create a database and the data access objects (DAOs) for a website similar to www.imdb.com; where the users will be able to:

See information about movies and their artists
Search the database by different criterias like:
Name of the movie
Genre of the movie
Rating of the movie
Year of the movie
Name of the artist
Name of the character on the movie
Director of the movie
For the movies, it has to have at least the poster of the movie, a brief summary, the title and year. Also lists of directors, actors, genres. and a rating field. 
Users will be able to add comments about the movies
Artists will have information about their name, date of birth (optional), place of birth, a biography, at least one picture, and the list of movies they have worked on.
You don't have to create the web site, just the DAO with the CRUD operations and create some test cases to validate that you are able to run the queries that were specified on point 2.
